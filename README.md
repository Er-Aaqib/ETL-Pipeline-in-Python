# Python ETL Pipeline: From Weather API to Data Insights
Creating a basic ETL pipeline in Python to retrieve weather data from an API, transform the data, and save it to a CSV file.

**1. Project Introduction**

This project, "Python ETL Pipeline: From Weather API to Data Insights", is designed as a guide to demonstrate how to construct an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Python. ETL pipelines are crucial in data engineering and analytics to extract data from various sources, transform it into the desired format, and load it into target systems for analysis or further processing. This project focuses on fetching weather data from an external API using Python, processing it, and loading it for further analysis.

**2. Objective**

The key objective of this project is to provide a clear and concise guide for building an ETL pipeline using Python. The pipeline performs the following functions:

- Extracts weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap).
- Transforms the data by processing and structuring it in a usable format.
- Loads the transformed data into a target system for analysis or storage.

**3. Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- IDE: VS Code
- API: OpenWeatherMap API ([OpenWeather API](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys))
- Libraries:
  - requests: for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
  - json: for parsing the JSON responses from the API.
  - pandas: for data manipulation and transformation.

**4. Project Overview**

 This ETL pipeline comprises three distinct modules, each designed to fetch weather data through different parameters from the OpenWeatherMap API.

**4.1. ETL Pipeline Overview**
 
 The pipeline follows the basic steps of extracting data from an external source, transforming it, and loading it into a specified destination. The transformation stage includes parsing the JSON data, filtering relevant information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, and structuring it into a suitable format. After the transformation, the data is saved as a CSV file for further analysis or storage.

**4.2. Data Sources and Transformation Process**
 
 The data source for this project is the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides real-time weather data. The extraction involves fetching the data from the API using different input parameters (city name, city ID, and ZIP code), followed by data transformation where the raw JSON data is filtered and organized. The transformed data is then saved as a CSV file, providing a structured format for easy access and further processing.

**4.3. Key Modules**

- **Fetch Weather Data by City Name:**
  - In this module, the pipeline takes the city name as an input parameter, sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and retrieves the weather data for that city [Built-in API request by city name](https://openweathermap.org/current#name)).

- **Fetch Weather Data by City ID:**
  - This module takes the unique city ID as the input parameter and returns the weather data for the corresponding city ([Built-in API request by city ID](https://openweathermap.org/current#cityid))

- **Fetch Weather Data by ZIP Code:**
  - In this module, the pipeline uses a ZIP code to request weather data for the region associated with the code. The API response is then parsed, and relevant weather data is extracted [Built-in API request by ZIP code](https://openweathermap.org/current#zip)).

**5. Challenges Faced**

- **Handling API Rate Limits:**
During development, managing the API's rate-limiting feature was a challenge, as it restricted the number of API requests made in a given period.

- **Data Transformation:**
Structuring the API's JSON response into a format suitable for analysis required careful parsing and manipulation of the data.

**6. Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the construction of a simple ETL pipeline using Python. It highlights the process of extracting data from an API, transforming the raw data into usable formats, and loading it for further use. The modular approach allows users to extend and modify the pipeline to work with other APIs or data sources.

**7. Future Enhancements**

Possible future improvements to this project include:

- **Database Integration:** Incorporating a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store the transformed data for large-scale analytics.

- **Automation:** Automating the ETL pipeline to run at scheduled intervals using tools like Apache Airflow or Cron jobs.

- **Visualization:** Adding a data visualization module to generate insights from the fetched weather data, such as temperature trends over time.
