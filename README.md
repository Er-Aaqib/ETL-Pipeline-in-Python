# Project Report: Python ETL Pipeline: From Weather API to Data Insights
Creating a basic ETL pipeline in Python to retrieve weather data from an API, transform the data, and save it to a CSV file.

**Project Introduction**

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a fundamental process in data engineering, crucial for gathering, transforming, and storing data from various sources into a usable format. As the backbone of data-driven decision-making, ETL pipelines enable businesses to integrate and analyze data efficiently. This project aims to demonstrate the creation of a simple ETL pipeline using Python, focusing on fetching real-time weather data from a public API, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into a CSV file. The project showcases how to handle data extraction, processing, and storageâ€”a foundational skill for anyone interested in data engineering or analytics.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to build a basic ETL pipeline that:

        1. Extracts real-time weather data from an external API using three distinct modules:
              -  By city name
              -  By city ID
              -  By zipcode
        2. Transforms the raw data into a structured format that is easy to analyze.
        3. Loads the processed data into a CSV file for storage and further analysis.
        
This project aims to provide a hands-on introduction to ETL processes using Python, emphasizing practical implementation and understanding the key steps involved in data engineering tasks.

**Scope of the Project**

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly guide, focusing on the essential components of an ETL pipeline:

        1. Data Extraction: The project will use Python to connect to a weather data API and fetch real-time data through three different modules:
              - City Name: Extract weather data by specifying the city name.
              - City ID: Fetch weather data using a unique city ID.
              - Zipcode: Obtain weather data based on the zipcode.
         2. Data Transformation: The extracted data will be cleaned, filtered, and organized into a structured format suitable for analysis. This step will include handling missing  values, converting data types, and formatting the data.
         3. Data Loading: The final step involves storing the transformed data into a CSV file, making it accessible for further analysis or reporting.


This guide will serve as a starting point for aspiring data engineers and analysts, giving them the tools and knowledge needed to tackle more advanced ETL projects in the future.

**Methodology**
        **SetUp**
        1. VS CODE installation 
        2. Download Python Extension
        3. Openweatherdata API Extraction 
        4. Define the Extract script 
        5. Define Transform script
        6. Define Load script

**Project Execution**
        Tasks and Milestones: completion of the milestone 4,5,6.

update and advancement in the possibility in the project, chatgpt suggestion.

**Conclusion**
take reference from the medium blogs and chatgpt.

**Recommendations**
recommendation like some courses to learn python,
books, blogs, etc

**Appendices**
use of different fuctions, constraints, characters in the whole script to make easy and understanding programme. 
like: f-string etc .
